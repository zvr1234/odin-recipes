        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Dough</h3>
            <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <h3>Topping</h3>
            <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese,
                <br>thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup no salt added canned crushed
                <br>tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top.
                <br>Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a
                <br>time until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls.
                <br>Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours.
                <br>Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</li>
            <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 288 degrees C.
                <br>Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch
                <br>gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone.
                <br>Place on the floured peel.
            </li>
            <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and
                <br>1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes
                <br>over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil
                <br>over top.
            </li>
            <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel
                <br>easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and
                <br>remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel
                <br>onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza.
                <br>Cut into wedges and serve.
            </li>
            <li>Follow steps 5 through 9 to make the second pizza</li>
        </ol>
