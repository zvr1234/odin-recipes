disclaimer: all info belongs and was taken straight from the respective recipe site that's linked under the recipe's description paragraph

This project was brought to you from a random project odin user, and was made as a finale of the HTML Foundation course
the project helped in both giving an opportunity to check again on the course's materials, and to see how well I can currently do when given a task to create full really really basic html site from scratch (albeit with a lot of copy paste from allrecipes website - https://www.allrecipes.com/)
